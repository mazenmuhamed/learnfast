      "When I first started my UX journey, we didn't have the luxury of endless resources like today, and even when there were many, finding the right ones to advance my career was a challenge. That's where LearnFast came in. It wasn't just another platform ‚Äî it was the missing piece. Imagine a place where learning feels like an adventure, where complex concepts become second nature through fun, interactive lessons. That's LearnFast. For me It wasn't just about learning theory ‚Äî LearnFast offered hands-on opportunities, like building a portfolio, getting peer feedback, and connecting with mentors, all of which helped me grow as a designer. While LearnFast wasn't the only factor in my success, it played a key role in helping me grow into someone who can guide and support other designers in their own journeys. Transitioning from a local to an international role, with a almost 150% salary increase, was an important step for me ‚Äî but what I value most is that I've become someone who can mentor and uplift others, thanks in part to the experiences I gained through LearnFast.",

      "LearnFast played a key role in sharpening my UX research skills, especially when it came to user interviews. Sorting through endless articles and tutorials can feel overwhelming, especially when a lot of it covers things you already know. But LearnFast's bite-sized lessons made it easy to refresh my knowledge and dive deeper into the topics that mattered most to me. I also found the reference links at the end of each lesson really helpful for extra learning. Strengthening my research skills through LearnFast gave me the confidence to go after new opportunities ‚Äî and it was a big part of landing my next role.",
